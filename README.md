# Insurance_prediction
Machine learning model created with Polynomial regression to predict the expense of specific client considering different dependent variables.


I work in the insurance industry and am a data science fanatic. Because data science is such a matter of great interest, I attempted to identify a common ground between the two. We typically utilise static code to compute premiums for clients based on various conditions, but we can make this process more efficient by developing a model for calculating premiums based on Life assurance behavioural information.
The objectives of this exercise are to investigate different features and their relationships, as well as to plot a multiple linear regression based on several features of an individual, such as age, physical/family condition, and location, against their existing medical expense in order to predict future medical expenses and assist medical insurance companies in determining premium rates.

Regreesion model used and analysed are linear and polynomial regression.
